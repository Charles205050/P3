# Initial Setup

After installing you should review some commonly changed settings before populating your store with products.

As an Administrator visit, *Store / Settings* within concrete5's Dashboard.

A suggested checklist of items to review is as follows:

- **Currency** - Adjust the currency symbol and number separators
- **Tax** - Adjust whether entered product prices are includes or exclusive of taxes
- **Shipping** - Adjust the units for weight and size
- **Notifications and Receipts** - Enter one or more emails for order notifications to be sent to
- **Cart and Checkout** - Adjust the guest checkout setting
