# Initial Setup

After installing you should review some commonly changed settings before populating your store with products.

As an Administrator visit, **Store / Settings** within concrete5's Dashboard.

A suggested checklist of items to review is as follows:

- **Currency** - Adjust the currency for the store
- **Tax** - Adjust whether entered product prices are includes or exclusive of taxes
- **Shipping** - Adjust the units for weight and size
- **Notifications and Receipts** - Enter one or more emails for order notifications to be sent to
- **Cart and Checkout** - Adjust the guest checkout setting

## Tax Setup

There are two ways that prices can be entered into Community Store, inclusive and exclusive of taxes.
This setting is adjusted via the Tax section of  **Store / Settings** within the dashboard - ensure you make this setting before entering products.

There are two steps to configure taxes:
- First, add a new tax rate via **Store / Settings / Tax ** and the 'Add Tax Rate' button
- Second, Edit a Tax Class and add the newly added Tax Rate to the list of rates

By default, the add-on installs a 'Default' tax class, and this is then automatically applied to all products.
Further Tax Classes allow different taxes to be applied in groups to specific products.
